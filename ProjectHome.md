The AjaxBrowser project begin in 2006 as a personal script to manage my own files on a remote server. At this time I was juggling between WindowsÂ® and Linux so I was looking for a cross-platform solution. As I was highly disappointed with FTP, I decided to create this project upon the popularity and portability of web browser.
